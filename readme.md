#Practicing AJAX

## Introduction

You're about to write AJAX-backed JavaScript that will access an API and loop through/display data using `setInterval`.

Make use of the fantastic and delicious https://api.doughnuts.ga.  Your task is to use your JS skills to fetch all the doughnuts in our database. Then, loop through the array and display each doughnut for one second.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

* Implement a jQuery AJAX request to the GA Doughnuts API. Make sure that the data can be printed to the Chrome console before continuing.
* Once the data has been received from the API, store the data into an array.
* Use `setInterval` to go through the array and display each doughnut to the screen, along with the flavor.

#### Deliverable

Make a list of existing doughnuts appear on the page, along with the flavor of each doughnut.
